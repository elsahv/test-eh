 <!-- I weave creativity into practical code. During the last few years, I've learned how to program web sites using
        javascript and javascript frameworks. I've utilized resources such as: youtube
        developer tutorials, Freecodecamp, The Odin Project and Geeks for Geeks.
        These are the websites that have been used to not only learn javascript,
        but to bring my passion projects to life.
